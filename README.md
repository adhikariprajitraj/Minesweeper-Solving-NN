# Minesweeper AI

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI capable of solving Minesweeper games. It includes a Python implementation of Minesweeper and an AI module that uses machine learning or heuristic algorithms to play the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Additional Python libraries: `numpy`, `pytest`, `pytorch`
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/adhikariprajitraj/Minesweeper-Solving-NN```
2. Navigate to the project directory
`cd minesweeper_ai`
3. Install the required Python libraries:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Structure
- `/ai`: AI model scripts for decision making.
- `/game`: Minesweeper game logic and utilities.
- `/tests`: Test scripts for both game logic and AI functionality.
- `/data`: Data storage for training the AI.
- `/docs`: Documentation of the project.

## Usage
To run the game with AI, execute the `main.py` script:
`python main.py`


## AI Model
The AI model can be trained using the scripts in the `/ai` directory. The model uses [describe the model, e.g., neural network, reinforcement learning, etc.] to make decisions.

## Testing
Run tests using `pytest` to ensure both game logic and AI functionality are working as expected:

`pytest`


## Documentation
For detailed information on project setup, game logic, and AI architecture, refer to the documents in the `/docs` folder.
